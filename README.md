EstimoteEditor
==============
This is an iOS8 compatible version of https://github.com/ygini/EstimoteEditor
It also makes it more obvious to monitor custom UUID that were not monitored before - see EETableViewController.m
This simple tool made for Estimote beacons allowing you to read data and edit minor and major numbers.
